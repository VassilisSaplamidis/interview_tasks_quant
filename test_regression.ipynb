    "\n",
    "An energy supplier provides electricity to it's customers in the Canton of Zurich. The customers are mainly businesses, offices and small industries. In order to buy the energy in the wholesale electricity market at the day before the delivery, the supplier needs to predict the total consumption of it's customers. \n",
    "\n",
    "The prediction takes place in the morning of every day and the next day's consumption needs to be forecasted.\n",
    "For example on **17.09.2023 08:00** we need to forecast the consumption from **18.09.2023 00:00 - 19.09.2023 00:00**\n",
    "\n",
    "The data available at the moment the prediction takes place are:\n",
    "- the weather forecasts for the next day (you can assume the forecast is perfect for this excersise)\n",
    "- the consumption of these customers up until the midnight of this day (eg. on **17.09.2023 08:00** the consumption up until **17.09.2023 00:00** is already known)\n",

    "## Dataset\n",

    "A dataset with the following columns:\n",
    "- `datetime_utc_from`: Datetime in UTC (the beginning of the hour)\n",
    "- `consumption_MWh`: The total electricity consumption of the energy supplier's customers (MWh)\n",
    "- `temperature_celsius`: Average temperature in the Canton of Zurich (Â°C)\n",
